# Common Caching Patterns

Effective caching is critical for optimizing performance, reducing latency, and improving scalability in modern applications. Serverless caching, in particular, enhances these benefits by eliminating infrastructure management while ensuring seamless integration with distributed architectures. AkkaCache.io provides a high-performance, managed caching layer that supports a variety of caching patterns tailored for serverless environments.

## Key Caching Considerations
Before choosing a caching pattern, it's important to understand key caching decisions:

- **Local vs Remote Caching** – Should data be cached within the application (local) or in an external cache service (remote)?
- **Read vs Write Caching** – Should caching occur when data is read (lazy-loading) or when it is written (write-through)?
- **Inline vs Aside Caching** – Should data flow through the cache (inline) or should the application decide when to use it (aside)?

## Common Caching Patterns
### Local Caching
- **Local Browser Caching** – Caches static assets like HTML, CSS, and images in the user’s browser.
- **Local Backend Caching** – Stores frequently used data within backend instances to reduce redundant requests.

### Remote Caching
- **Read-Aside Caching (Lazy Loading)** – The application checks the cache before querying the database. If the data isn’t found, it retrieves and stores it in the cache for future use.
- **Write-Aside Caching** – Data is written directly to the database, and the cache is updated separately to ensure consistency.

### Automated Caching
- **Read-Through and Write-Through Caching** – The cache acts as an intermediary, automatically handling read and write operations to keep data fresh.
- **Write-Behind Caching** – Similar to write-through but defers writes to the database, improving application performance.

## Serverless Caching and AkkaCache.io
Serverless applications benefit greatly from managed caching solutions that eliminate infrastructure concerns. AkkaCache.io enhances these caching patterns with:

- **Automatic Scaling** – Adjusts dynamically to workload demands.
- **Global Availability** – Ensures low-latency access across distributed systems.
- **Optimized Cost Efficiency** – Only charges for actual cache usage.

## Conclusion
Caching is a fundamental optimization technique, and selecting the right caching pattern is crucial for performance and scalability. Serverless caching, powered by AkkaCache.io, provides a robust, managed solution that integrates seamlessly into cloud-native and distributed environments, ensuring high availability and low latency.
