Setup and preparation for using the cache service

# Prerequisites

<!-- more -->

There are only a few things you'll need in order to use **Akka Cache**.

## Akka Account
You'll need an [akka.io](https://console.akka.io) account. Within this account, you will need a project that has enough available capacity to support the service and whatever storage it might consume.

## Akka CLI
You'll need the `akka` [CLI](https://doc.akka.io/reference/cli/installation.html) installed in order to issue the necessary command to deploy the cache service.
