# Overview
**Akka Cache** is a ready-to-use drop-in service that you can deploy in any of your [akka.io](https://console.akka.io) projects.

This service gives you access to an elastic, resilient cache that has all of the characteristics and benefits of your own Akka services. Once deployed in your project, you can choose into which regions you'll deploy. Every region with the **Akka Cache** service will have locally-replicated cache data.

Typically when we realize that we're going to need a key-value cache, we have to worry about provisioning (and paying for ðŸ’¸) a big, bulky, and costly central server. By implementing this cache with a simple Akka component, you don't have to worry about any of that.
